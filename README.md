# Coral ANGSD Pipeline

Population genomics pipeline for *Acropora palmata* (elkhorn coral) using a two-pass ANGSD workflow. Designed to run on a local workstation, SLURM HPC, or AWS EC2 with Singularity containers.

**Vollmer Lab — Florida Atlantic University**

---

## Study System

96 *A. palmata* colonies sampled across two regions:
- **Florida** (FL): Florida Keys reef system
- **Panama** (PA): Caribbean Panama

Research questions: population structure, gene flow, local adaptation, and relatedness across the Florida–Panama range.

## Pipeline Strategy

### Why two-pass ANGSD?

ANGSD works on genotype likelihoods rather than hard genotype calls, making it well-suited for low-to-moderate coverage coral resequencing data. A single-pass approach requires choosing SNP filters before knowing the data; a two-pass approach lets the data inform the filters:

1. **Pass 1 — Discovery**: Scan the whole genome with relaxed filters (60% of individuals, low MAF) to identify candidate SNPs. Fast because it only outputs a SNP position list.
2. **Pass 2 — Genotype Likelihoods**: Revisit only those SNP positions with strict filters (80% of individuals, MAF > 0.10), computing full genotype likelihood arrays (Beagle format) for downstream analysis.

This avoids computing full GL arrays for every site in the genome, which would be prohibitively slow.

### Disk strategy

All intermediate files are marked `temp()` in Snakemake and deleted automatically once no longer needed:

```
FASTQ (raw)      → deleted after fastp
FASTQ (trimmed)  → deleted after BWA
BAM (raw)        → deleted after dedup
BAM (dedup)      → deleted after CRAM filter
CRAM (filtered)  → kept permanently (~50% smaller than BAM)
```

Peak disk usage during a 96-sample run is bounded by how many samples are being processed simultaneously, not by total sample count.

## Pipeline Steps

### Stage 1 — Read Processing

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `download_sra` | fasterq-dump | Downloads paired-end reads from NCBI SRA. On AWS EC2 (us-east-1), NCBI routes to their free S3 bucket so transfer costs nothing. Raw FASTQs deleted after trimming. |
| `fastp` | fastp | Adapter trimming, poly-G tail removal, per-cycle quality trimming. Produces per-sample HTML/JSON QC report. |
| `bwa_map` | BWA-MEM + samtools | Aligns trimmed reads to the *A. palmata* reference genome with read groups for downstream compatibility. |
| `mark_duplicates` | samtools markdup | Marks PCR duplicates in-stream without removing them (ANGSD handles duplicates internally). |
| `filter_mapped` | samtools view | Retains only properly paired, uniquely mapped reads (MAPQ ≥ 20) on chromosomes ≥ 10 Mb. Stored as CRAM with embedded reference path for portability. |

### Stage 2A — SNP Discovery and Population Structure

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `angsd_discover_snps` | ANGSD | Pass 1: scans all CRAMs genome-wide with relaxed filters (60% individuals) to identify candidate SNP positions. |
| `angsd_genotype_likelihoods` | ANGSD | Pass 2: computes genotype likelihoods at pass-1 SNPs with strict filters (80% individuals, MAF > 0.10). Outputs Beagle-format GL matrix. |
| `ngsld_estimate` | ngsLD | Estimates pairwise LD (r²) between all SNP pairs within 500 kb windows. |
| `ld_decay` | Python | Calculates the LD decay curve by distance bin to determine the pruning window size. |
| `ld_prune` | Python | Greedy graph-based LD pruning: removes one SNP from each pair with r² > 0.3. Pure Python — no external dependency. |
| `pcangsd` | PCAngsd | PCA and admixture proportions (K = 2–5) directly from genotype likelihoods on LD-pruned SNPs. |
| `ngsrelate` | ngsRelate | Estimates pairwise kinship (KING) from genotype likelihoods. Flags related pairs and putative clones. |

### Stage 2B — Diversity and Differentiation

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `angsd_saf` | ANGSD | Computes site allele frequency likelihoods (SAF) per population using all sites — not just SNPs — for unbiased diversity estimates. |
| `realSFS` | ANGSD | Optimizes 1D and 2D site frequency spectra from SAF likelihoods via expectation-maximization. |
| `angsd_thetas` | ANGSD | Computes per-site θ and summarizes: nucleotide diversity (π), Watterson's θ, and Tajima's D per population. |
| `fst_estimate` | realSFS | Genome-wide weighted FST between each population pair from the joint 2D SFS. |
| `fst_windows` | realSFS | Sliding-window FST across the genome for Manhattan plots and outlier detection. |
| `heterozygosity` | ANGSD | Per-individual heterozygosity from single-sample SAF likelihoods. |

### Stage 3 — QC and Reporting

| Step | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `multiqc` | MultiQC | Aggregates fastp QC reports across all samples into a single interactive report. |
| `depth_summary` | samtools coverage | Per-sample mean depth and breadth of coverage from CRAMs. |
| `filtering_summary` | samtools flagstat | Read counts at each filtering stage per sample. |
| `fst_outlier_annotation` | Python | Annotates FST outlier windows with nearby genes from the GFF annotation. |
| `generate_report` | Python/matplotlib | Self-contained HTML report with embedded figures + separate 300 DPI PNGs saved to `results/figures/`. |

## Running the Pipeline

### Requirements

- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) ≥ 9.0
- [Singularity/Apptainer](https://apptainer.org) ≥ 1.3 (for containerized rules)
- `fasterq-dump` (SRA toolkit) installed on the host — the container version has TLS issues on EC2
- `ngsLD` compiled from source on the host — not in bioconda

### Local workstation

```bash
snakemake --snakefile workflow/Snakefile --profile profiles/local
```

Set `local_conda_env` in `config/config.yaml` to your conda environment path.

### SLURM HPC

```bash
snakemake --snakefile workflow/Snakefile --profile profiles/slurm
```

### AWS EC2

```bash
snakemake --snakefile workflow/Snakefile \
  --cores 16 --jobs 4 --keep-going --latency-wait 120 \
  --rerun-incomplete --rerun-triggers mtime \
  --use-singularity \
  --singularity-args '--bind /home/ubuntu --bind /usr/local/bin --bind /opt' \
  --config samples_csv=config/samples_aws_test.csv \
  > snakemake.log 2>&1 &
```

Comment out `local_conda_env` in `config/config.yaml` on AWS — containers provide the correct PATH.
